# My Wordle

![mywordle](https://res.cloudinary.com/dklakm8v6/image/upload/v1661190417/github%20images/my_wordle__dyjxeu.webp)

My wordle is a fractional clone of the real wordle game. I am calling it fractional because it doesn't have most of the features.

Currently the solution is hardcoded value but looking for an api to get list of words.

This is was a research project not an actual side project.

## Tech Used

- [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [TailwindCss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

# Getting Started

Clone the project with the following command:

```command
git clone https://github.com/TousifProvat/MyWordle.git
```

After clonning run the following command:

```command
yarn dev
```

or

```command
npm run dev
```

Now you can play with the code locally

# Todo

- Add win/lose alert
- Add retry functionality
- Randomize the solution word (It is hardcoded now)
- Add Word Validity Check
- Improve UX
  - Shake Line when invalid word input
- Add keyboard for mobile/tablets
